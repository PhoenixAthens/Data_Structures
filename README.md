# Data_Structures

### I hope to re-create every data-structure in the collections framework, with an even better implementation than provided.

> So far

## Basic Hash Table:
> this hash table uses a simple & basic hash-function to decide the location of Object in the object array
> the deprecated implementation of method: CalculatePosition results in multiple values being assigned to the same packet, as a solution 
> to that problem, a better implementation has been used, that implements a hash-function with a much better spread.
## An even better implementation using List<T> as packet for each slot in the array will be uploaded soon
